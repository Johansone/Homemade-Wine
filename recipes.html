                    <li>Fresh apples 6 lb;
                    </li>
                    <li>Sugar 3 lb;</li>

                    <li>Campden tablets.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="instructions">
                    <p>Preparing your apples - wash them (in water only – no chemicals).
                        Coarsely chop your raisins, so that the skin is broken on almost all of them. Place them into a large stainless steel pot and pour approximately one gallon of boiling hot water over them. Bring the mixture to a boil, add 2 lb of sugar stirring constantly, then simmer for around 10 minutes. Take off the heat and let the mixture cool down.

                    </p>

                    <p>Now you can chop your apples. When ready, place them into the fermentation bin or bucket, add the raisin mixture and leave it to rest overnight (or for a minimum of 8 hours) in a warm room temperature.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>The next day, you should find that the must has started foaming and the apples float on the surface. Add the lemon juice or citric acid and stir it well. Then, add the wine yeast and the yeast nutrient, stir again and cover the fermentation bin. You will now have to leave the wine to continue its primary fermentation for at least another 5 days. Check on it twice a day and give it a stir with a sterilized spoon.</p><br>

                    <p>The next step is to carefully pour the must into the straining bag placed over a large enough bowl. Then, squeeze the bag well so that you can release as much of the fermented apple juice as possible. Now it’s time to move your wine into a carboy (demijohn). In order to do this, place your funnel on the top of the carboy and very slowly and carefully pour the liquid through. Then tap the bung into place and fix your airlock on top. Store your wine-filled carboy in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight. In total, the wine will probably need to ferment for at least 3 weeks.</p><br>

                    <div class="infoParagraph">
                        <p>After 3 weeks, it should be ready for siphoning.

                            <p>Put your wine-filled carboy on a raised, flat surface. Then, position your empty carboy on the ground, lower than the wine-filled carboy. Remove the bung and airlock from your wine, and start lowering your siphoning tube all the way down to the bottom of the wine-filled carboy, stopping around half an inch above the bottom. Then, take the other end of the tube and suck as hard as you can until the wine starts flowing freely through the tube. Quickly stick the tube into the empty carboy and watch how it slowly fills up the empty carboy with wine. </p>

                    <p>Wash and chop pears and place them in a primary fermentation container. Add sugar and citric acid, and pour boiled water over. Stir until the sugar has dissolved and let it cool down to room temperature.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>After about 24 hours, add the yeast. Cover the mixture with a lid and place it in a dark, warm place. The sugar from the pear juice will turn into alcohol helped by the enzymes from the yeast.</p><br>

                    <p>Stir this mixture daily for about one week. After one week, pour the mixture into a secondary fermentation container and gently squeeze out the fruit pulp. This container should be airtight.</p><br>

                    <p>Leave the mixture in this airtight container for about three months. After that, pour the wine into sterilized wine bottles, and store for approximately 6 - 12 months. Remember, the longer you age the wine, the better it will taste.</p>

                    <p>Mash cleaned ripe strawberries.
                        Dissolve sugar in warm water.
                    </p>

                    <p>Put the mashed strawberries into a container; add sugary syrup and handful of raisins. Thoroughly stir it. Raisins contain wild wine yeast, which facilitate fermentation. You can manage without them, but you’ll have no guarantee that the strawberry will ferment. You may choose to add wine yeast instead or in addition. Fill a large stainless steel pot up to ¾ of its volume; otherwise the must might overflow during the fermentation.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>Cover the pot with gauze and leave it for about a week in a dark place with a temperature of 61-77F°. In order to prevent mold from appearing and the juice from souring, stir the must with a sterilized spoon every day.</p><br>

                    <p>After about a week, when you see the signs of active fermentation (foaming, hissing sound, and fermented odor), it should be ready for siphoning. Carefully pour the wine from the sediment through a siphoning tube. Squeeze the pulp through straining bag or cheesecloth.</p><br>

                    <p>Pour all of the wine into a clean carboy (demijohn). Install an air lock. Move the carboy into a dark warm place (65-74F°).</p><br>

                    <p>After 35-45 days, the fermentation will be finished (the air lock will stop bubbling). Now you can pour the wine from the sediment through a siphoning tube in bottle for storing. </p><br>

                    <p>Leave the bottles in a cellar for about two months, that’s when the taste will have matured and will be at its best. Stronger wine (with more alcohol content) can be kept for about a year or year and a half, lighter wine – for 6-8 months.

                <div class="instructions">
                    <p>Before plum wine is made, plums are collected and left under direct sunlight to dry a little. A couple of days in the sun is enough to cover the surface of the plums with wild leaven for fermentation. Please note that plums should not be washed before drying.</p><br>

                    <p>Wipe the dried plums with a wet cloth. Then, pit and mash the plums. Place the plum pulp in a bucket, cover with gauze, and leave it in a warm place for a few days. Stir the must once every 10-12 hours. Wait until you see the signs of active fermentation (foaming, hissing sound, and fermented odor).</p><br>

                    <p>Pour the plum must through a fine sieve or gauze and mix it with half of the sugar dissolved in water. Pour the must into a fermentation tank and fix an airlock on top of the carboy. Leave it in a warm (room temperature), dark place. The remaining half of the sugar is divided in half and poured into the carboy with a 5-day interval.</p><br>

                    <p>After fermentation, the plum wine is ripened for six months. Once a month the wine has to be moved from the sediment through a siphoning tube to a different carboy. The final time it can be poured into bottles for storing.</p><br>

                    <p>After 10 days, pulp from fruit will have raised to the top in the fermentation process. Carefully remove the pulp with a spoon. Pour all of the fermented must into a carboy, using a gauze, and squeeze the gauze thoroughly. Then install an air lock. Move the carboy into a dark, warm place. </p><br>

                    <p>The fermentation process could take approximately 40 days. When the water in the airlock stops bubbling - the fermentation process has finished. The wine should become transparent. Pour the wine from the sediment into bottles through a siphoning tube for storing. Make sure that each bottle has a cork and foil cap.</p><br>
